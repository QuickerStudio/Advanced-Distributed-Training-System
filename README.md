# AdvancedDistributedTrainingSystem

## Overview
**AdvancedDistributedTrainingSystem** is a high-performance distributed framework for training large-scale deep learning models. It employs advanced techniques like data/model parallelism, storage optimization with DeepSpeed's ZeRO, and communication enhancements.

## Features
- **Data Parallelism**: Utilizes PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) for efficient data parallel training.
- **Model Parallelism**: Supports tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism for handling larger models and speeding up training.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Uses PyTorch's automatic mixed precision (AMP) to reduce memory usage and increase computational efficiency.
- **Storage Optimization**: Implements DeepSpeed's ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer) to minimize memory footprint and support large model training.
- **Communication Optimization**: Includes gradient compression and communication scheduling to reduce communication overhead.
- **Secure Communication**: Uses gRPC with SSL/TLS for secure and encrypted communication between distributed nodes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PyTorch
- DeepSpeed
- CUDA
- Python 3.x
- gRPC and cryptography libraries

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/AdvancedDistributedTrainingSystem.git
   cd AdvancedDistributedTrainingSystem
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install torch deepspeed grpcio grpcio-tools cryptography
   ```

### Running the Training
1. Set up environment variables for distributed training:
   ```sh
   export MASTER_ADDR=localhost
   export MASTER_PORT=12355
   ```

2. Generate gRPC code from the .proto file:
   ```sh
   python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. distributed.proto
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### Building the EXE File
1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```sh
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Run the build script:
   ```sh
   python build_exe.py
   ```

This will create a single EXE file for the project, which can be distributed and run on other machines.
